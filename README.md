# Factory Method Design Pattern

I made this repository to explain in a easy way how the factory method design pattern works.

We created two class called Warrior and Sorcerer that inherance a class called Human, who have an atributes like name, health, maxHealth and one method called displayInfo.

Warrior and Sorcerer have two methods, getMainSkill and setNewSkillLvl.

After we create a class called VocationFactory who have a method called createCharacter that will be responsible to instantiate and return one class depending of arguments.
